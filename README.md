Simple Local Music Player (Python)

The goal of this music player is to allow offline music playback. This player doesn't have telemetry. Doesnt check in online for metadata, and is a simple way to enjoy your music collection.

This uses pip pygame and ffprobe from the system. I will work on including the ffprobe in the bin folder and creating a release with pyinstaller that is an all in one installation in the future.

The player offers the ability to navigate to local folders. My family and I love the experience and I will continue to iron out any found bugs and slowly add features over time.
